      <p id = "introtext"> Hi, I'm Varsha, a second-year Computer Science major and a Health & Medical Sciences minor here at Georgia Tech! I'm passionate about the intersection of technology and healthcare, and I am involved in research through my VIP, Diabetes & Chronic Diseases Systems. I also advocate for youth education on and invovlement of youth in world politics and social issues, and during high school I worked as the Chief Operating Officer of a non-profit that did so, Foreign Policy Youth Collaborative. In my free time I love to read, crochet, and try new coffee and matcha places. I would love to join the Bits of Good developer bootcamp to develop my skills and give back to the community!
